#[Predictive Analysis for the Clinic] (https://github.com/srakarsh18/Akarsh_portfolio)

* The data is real given by a clinic, but the values are fake.
* This is the task given as a assesment for the internship.
* Data format was in csv file, had a choice to use Google sheets or Excel.
* If necessary, I can use python, sql etc for making the queries.
* I am supposed to predict the future revenue using the 6 months data for the next 12 months.

 Predictive analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that makes predictions about future outcomes using historical data combined with statistical modeling, data mining techniques and machine learning. Companies employ predictive analytics to find patterns in this data to identify risks and opportunities.

## My approach
* Used Google sheets for formatting the data, because original data was from the same.
* As the data is not that big, so kept simple & effective, So, didnt used python or sql for this Project.
* Using all the tools like Pivot, sum, Prediction & many more in google sheets.
