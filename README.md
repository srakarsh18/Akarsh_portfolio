#[Predictive Analysis for the Clinic] (https://github.com/srakarsh18/Akarsh_portfolio)

* The data is real given by a clinic, but the values are fake.
* This is the task given as a assesment for the internship.
* Data format was in csv file, had a choice to use Google sheets or Excel.
* If necessary, I can use python, sql etc for making the queries.
* I am supposed to predict the future revenue using the 6 months data for the next 12 months.

 Predictive analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that makes predictions about future outcomes using historical data combined with statistical modeling, data mining techniques and machine learning. Companies employ predictive analytics to find patterns in this data to identify risks and opportunities.

## My approach
* Used Google sheets for formatting the data, because original data was from the same.
* As the data is not that big, so kept simple & effective, So, didnt used python or sql for this Project.
* Using all the tools like Pivot, sum, Prediction & many more in google sheets.
* Instead of predicting only revenue, I dismantled the data for each clinic, to showcase the performance and number of patients visiting specific clinic along specific practioners.
* Predicted the overall revenve for the 12 months.
* I also predicted which are the several factors which are linked for the major revenue changes.
* Predicted how many customers each practioners for specific clinic can be expected and what will be the revenue.

### Key Takeaway
* Gave an insight of how we can look on data to predict the future by tracking the small parameters.
* While predicting the future revenue we can develop a new strategies in order to increase the revenue.
* How a visual graph or pictures explain the whole data in a meaningful way.
* How to see the problem and find the solution by calculating the necessary the factors.
